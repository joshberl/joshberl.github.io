1. I believe that all aspects of the assignment have been implemented as specified.

2. Collaborated and discussed the assignment with Bruno Olmedo, Rachael Robinson, Deanna Bessy, Julie Sanduski.

3. Spent roughly 7-8 hours on the assignment. Had functional HTML and CSS after 1.5 hours, but wanted to practice and learn more CSS.
